How often does it rain annually in the Melbourne area?If you filtered your dataframe for Location == 'Melbourne' or MelbourneAirport, the \"Yes\" percentage represents the annual rainfall frequency.Formula: $\\frac{\\text{Count of Yes}}{\\text{Total Count}} \\times 100$Typical Result: In Melbourne, it rains roughly 20–25% of the days in this dataset.2. How accurate would you be if you just assumed it won't rain every day?This is called the Baseline Accuracy (or Zero Rule).If you simply predicted \"No\" for every single day, you would be correct every time it actually didn't rain.Since \"No\" appears ~76% of the time, your accuracy would be 76% without using any machine learning at all.Key Takeaway: Your machine learning model must achieve an accuracy higher than this baseline to be considered useful.3. Is this a balanced dataset?No, it is Imbalanced.There are significantly more negative examples (\"No\") than positive examples (\"Yes\"). This is dangerous because a model can get high accuracy by simply ignoring the minority class (Rain).4. Next Steps?Split the data: Divide into Training and Testing sets.Train a Model: Start with Logistic Regression.Evaluate: Do not rely solely on \"Accuracy.\" You must check the F1-Score or Recall to ensure the model is actually catching the \"Rain\" days"
